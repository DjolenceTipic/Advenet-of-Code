## Description

For both parts i was created `Dictionary<string, (string, string)>` where i mapped all data.

### PART ONE
Iterate once throught a map, find steps. Easy.

### PART TWO
Iterate six times throught map (once for each starting poing), stop when you find node that ends with a `Z`, add steps number to an array. Find LCM for these 6 steps. 

### Good look!
