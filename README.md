# Advent-of-Code

![.NET](https://github.com/DjolenceTipic/Advent-of-Code/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
Solutions are not best nor fastest, but they are my solutions :smile:

The folder for each day contains:

- Task of the day (readMe.md file)
- Input for the given task
- Code to solve the given task (main file is always "Program.cs")
- My solutions to the given input are at the end of readMe.md file

	For example:

	<details>
	  <summary><strong><em>See result here</em></strong></summary>
		Your puzzle answer was <strong><em>133</em></strong>.
	</details>

 - Be free to use it for testing your solution.

## Specfication
Solutions are done in .NET Core 3.0.
