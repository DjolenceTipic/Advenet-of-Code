# Advent-of-Code

![.NET](https://github.com/DjolenceTipic/Advent-of-Code/workflows/.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
Solutions are not the best nor fastest, but they are my solutions :smile:

The folder for each day contains:
- Code to solve the given task (main file is always "Program.cs")
- Be free to use it for testing your solution.

## Specification
Solutions are done in .NET Core 3.0.

So I will not include anything but code in this repo. Older solutions will be updated accordingly over time :)
